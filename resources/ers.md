# fxServer, framework and script compatibility

## fxServer gamebuild & artifacts version
1. **ERS was tested and considered compatible with gamebuild 3323**
Use the recommended settings below, do not use older gamebuilds / artifacts, unless you want to test compatiblity yourself. We do not offer support when you are using non-recommended setups.
- Gamebuild tested and considered compatible for: 3323.
- Artifacts version tested and considered compatible for: 13079. 

*Note: Do not use artifacts version (so called recommended) 7290 with newer gamebuilds, this does not work properly. We tend to use the latest artifacts version available. The gamebuild is not always compatible, use what we recommend or test compatibility yourself. This seems to be the best way to go.*

## OneSync
1. **ERS requires OneSync Legacy/Infinity**
You must enable OneSync Legacy or Infinity.
 - It is likely that some hosting companies have a dashboard in which you also need to set `Enable Beyond` to 1, instead of 0.

## WARNING
1. **ERS is currently not compatible with**
We sometimes reach out to the creators to find a resolution for both of the parties.
 - RemoveCops-AI (confirmed)

## Standalone

1. **With or without frameworks**
   - ERS is a standalone product. It works without any framework, but also alongside most known frameworks.

## ESX
1. **Permissions to go on shift**  
   - The ERS resource has 4 service types. ESX permissions can be used to allow players access by their job name and can be setup in `night_ers/config/config.lua`.

2. **Weapons**  
   - Weapons can be configured in `night_ers/config/gear-config.lua` and the code handling item distribution can be adjusted to ESX in `night_ers/client/c_functions.lua`.

## QBcore
1. **Permissions to go on shift**  
   - The ERS resource has 4 service types. QBCore permissions can be used to allow players access by their job name or their QB permissions and can be setup in `night_ers/config/config.lua`.

2. **Weapons**  
   - Weapons can be configured in `night_ers/config/gear-config.lua` and the code handling item distribution can be adjusted to QBCore in `night_ers/client/c_functions.lua`.

ensure night_shifts #optional
ensure night_ers #required
ensure ebu_flatbeds_ers #optional
ensure night_ers_worldevents #optional DLC
ensure night_ers_weighstation #optional DLC
```

## Configuring the night_ers config.lua file

*Note: Always check your FiveM server console and F8 client console for errors, you need these errors to locate your issue if you have one.*

1. **Download VS Code**  
   - We insist on you downloading Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to read and write (lua) files: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. **Open the config file**  
   - Open `night_ers/config/config.lua` in VS Code. 

3. **Read file contents**  
   - Once you've downloaded Visual Studio Code, open the file (or folder) to read its contents. Example: `night_ers/config/config.lua`, `night_ers/client/c_functions.lua`, `night_ers/server/s_functions.lua`.

4. **Understand configuration**  
   - When configuring the resource you will see that each line has an explanation written at the end of it. During the process of configuring and testing what you've configured you'll figure out what things are for. Every variable is named so that you can relate to what you are editing.

5. **Watch for notes**  
   - Keep an eye out for notes! On some parts, we provide warnings on what you should not edit, add, or remove. Relax mode on and read it all to understand it.

6. **Cofigure in order**  
   - It's required to configure in order when setting up this resource's config file, we recommend going from top to bottom. 

7. **Language, entity, fictive names and gear configs**
   - `night_ers/config/*.lua` contains more config files for you to edit and adjust to your liking. All these files require some understanding of the resource to be able to properly edit them. Feel free to ask the [Discord community](https://discord.nights-software.com) for help if you need it.
    - Weapon and clothing settings can be found in `night_ers/config/gear-config.lua`

*Hint: You will take some time to configure this the way you like, so plan that time and take your time to read! Frequently test your edits to see whether you're making mistakes and where to find them. Trying stuff early is good for confirming that your resource works. Use the F8 console and server console (txAdmin) to check for errors, these lead to solutions.*

# Creating ERS callouts

## A guide for creating callouts for the Emergency Response Simulator

1. **Accessing callout scripts**  
   - The ERS resource contains a folder called `night_ers/callouts/*.lua`. All scripts in this folder are open source, which means you can add, remove, or edit callouts.

2. **Using ERS functions**  
   - ERS has multiple built-in functions, just like the FiveM native documentation, we've built our own set of functionalities. You will have to use these to properly create and handle callout entities. These ERS functions are listed below.

3. **Providing callout packs**  
   - Providing free or paid ERS callout packs is allowed. Many of our community members are planning to sell or provide callout packs. We approve this, as long as you follow [FiveM](https://forum.cfx.re/) (CFX) and [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/) policy (terms of service). Basically, provide paid scripts via [Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/). We are to report any illegal trade or distribution to authorities.

## The format for adding a callout (config, server & client)
*IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE CALLOUT CREATION IS FOR DEVELOPERS*

**Support notice**
- Nights Software does not offer support for creating custom callouts, besides the documentation. Ask the community instead!
    - If you do not have an understanding of developing you'll need to learn this first. You will be told the same thing in a ticket. Even though we love our community and love to help, we don't have the capacity (yet) to provide support for callout creation. Read these documented instructions carefully and ask our community to share knowledge!

## Callout Creator Pack

1. **Nights Software has created a Callout Creator Pack to help you create your own callouts. This pack includes an example callout and a documentation on how to create your own callouts.**  
  - [Download the free Callout Creator Pack here](https://store.nights-software.com/package/6374594).

## Task List for creating one callout
- [x] **Task 1** 
- Enter the `night_ers/callouts/plugins/` folder and copy an existing `.lua` callout file or paste in a newly created callout file.
- [x] **Task 2** 
- Rename the file to your desired callout name.
- [x] **Task 3**  
- Adjust the config, client and server code (all of them) within your new file to your liking.
- [x] **Task 4**  
- Test the callout and make sure it works as intended by restarting the script and spawning the callout afterwards. (/requestcallout)

## Important notes
- Find all ERS functions below.
- Make sure to use the correct syntax and formatting.
- Test your callout thoroughly to ensure it works as intended.
- Consider adding comments to your code to explain your logic and reasoning for certain actions.

# Editing open source functions
*Are you not familiar with code? Then skip this section or take on the challenge!*

1. **Open source script files**  
   - Besides `night_ers/callouts/*.lua`, we have provided 2 open script files containing functions you can edit to your desire. A client side functions script `night_ers/client/c_functions.lua` and a server side functions script `night_ers/server/s_functions.lua`. You can also write events or new functions in them if you need to for your custom add-ons or edits. 

2. **Explore the functions**  
   - Feel free to take a look. We have provided these functions open source and you are expected to edit them yourself if you like. Nights software does not provide specific support for custom framework integrations. But you can of course ask us any question and we will try to see if our knowledge can help you.

## Client `night_ers/client/c_functions.lua`

1. **Event triggers**  
   - The ERS resource has multiple event triggers like the following example functions. There are more in this file, discover them all!

```lua
function OnIsOfferedCallout(calloutdata)
    -- Add your code here. Keep in mind they are offered a callout. It is possible they will not accept the callout.

    -- if Config.Debug then
    --     for k, v in pairs(calloutdata) do
    --         print("key: "..k)
    --         if type(v) == "table" then
    --             print(json.encode(v))
    --         else
    --             if type(v) == "boolean" then
    --                 print(v)
    --             else
    --                 print("value: "..v)
    --             end
    --         end
    --     end
    -- end
end

function OnAcceptedCalloutOffer(calloutdata)
    -- Add your code here. Keep in mind they have accepted a callout. It is possible they will cancel before arrival (and spawn of entities).
end

function OnArrivedAtCallout(calloutdata)
    -- Add your code here. This is triggered right before the entities are built for a callout. This code will execute first.

end

function OnEndedACallout() -- Contains no callout data.
    -- Add your code here. This is triggered right before the entities are deleted or callout is cancelled serverside. This code will execute first.
    
end
```

## Server `night_ers/server/s_functions.lua`

1. **Event triggers**  
   - The ERS resource has multiple event triggers, also serverside. Discover them all!

# Help us or let us help you
Get in touch for feedback or support, join our Discord and make use of our ticket system!

## Troubleshoot

- **FAQ Answers**
  - SmartFires and SmartHose resource actually need to be named to `SmartFires` and `SmartHose`, otherwise fire & smoke callouts will bug out your callout system. The same goes for SmartFiresLite and SmartHoseLite.
  - MDT integration? Make sure to enable ERS in `night_shifts` and enable Night Shifts in `night_ers`. Duty toggled through the MDT.
  - Read the compatibility knowledge below for more wisdom.

- **Compatibility knowledge**
  - Iceline Hosting: Enable Beyond by setting it to 1 in your server dashboard, otherwise entities will not spawn.
  - RemoveCopsAI: Remove this resource, it does not work with ERS, because it removes spawned entities by ERS.
  - Clear world commands / Anti cheat » Usually causes issues when deleting ERS entities, which should not be deleted by other scripts. Most ERS entities spawn server side so are usually not affected by Anti Cheat.
