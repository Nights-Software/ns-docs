## Purchasing the resource

Find this product at:

Base: [https://store.nights-software.com/package/5205763](https://store.nights-software.com/package/5205763)

## Downloading the resource

Download this resource via [https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets](https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets) after purchasing it. It can take a few minutes for the resource to appear in the CFX Portal after purchase.

## Installing the resource

*Note: Always make sure when you transfer files to your server you follow this order: (Otherwise you will experience parsing errors in F8 console.)*

```
ZIP Package -> Unpack in a folder on your local machine -> Set your File Transfer Protocol (FTP) type to binary -> drag from local machine into the server resources folder -> server.cfg (ensure script) and then boot up the server.
```

1. Drag the resource into your resources folder.

1. Ensure or start this resource in your server.cfg. Example:
```lua
ensure night_discord_vperms
```

1. Configure /config/config.lua.

## Troubleshoot

1. Are you being kicked out of the vehicle, but do have the requires roles for it? 

- There are 2 options: Discord API is not working (Check it's config and server console printouts)
- You have defined the wrong vehicle model name. Turn on debug in the config.lua, restart the script, enter the vehicle, check F8 console logs for it's actual name. Is it a weird number? Fix your vehicles.meta file for that vehicle. We do not provide support for this.

## Support
