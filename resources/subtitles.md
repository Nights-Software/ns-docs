## Installing Subtitles for FiveM

1. Place 'night_subtitles' into your resources folder.

2. Ensure / start 'night_subtitles' in your server.cfg.

Example:
```lua
ensure night_subtitles
```

## Export usage
In your client side script:
```lua
exports.night_subtitles:DisplaySubtitle(text, duration_in_milliseconds) -- params: (string, number) | example: ("Hello World", 5000)
```

## Configuring the config.lua file

*Note: Always check your FiveM server console and F8 client console for errors, you need these errors to locate your issue if you have one.*

1. We recommend downloading Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to read (lua) files: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

1. Open /config/config.lua in VS Code. 

1. Once you've downloaded Visual Studio Code, open the file (or folder) with it to read it's contents, like: `config/config.lua`, `client/c_functions.lua`, `server/s_functions.lua`.

1. When configuring the resource you will see that each line has and explanation written at the end of it. During the process of configuring and testing what you've configured you'll figure out what things are for. Every variable is named so that you can relate to what you are editing.

1. Keep eye out for notes! On some parts we provide warnings on what you should not edit, add or remove. Relax mode on and read it all to understand it.

1. It's smart to follow an order when setting up this resources' config file, we recommend going from top-to-bottom: 

*Hint: You will take some time to configure this the way you like, so plan that time and take your time to read! Frequently test your edits to see whether you're making mistakes and where to find them. Trying stuff early is good for confirming that your resource works, but not for trying out it's functionalities.*

## Editing c_functions.lua / s_functions.lua

Are you not familiar with code? Then skip this section or take on the challenge!

We have provided 2 open script files containing functions you can edit to your desire. A client side functions script `c_functions.lua` and a server side functions script `s_functions.lua`. You can also write events or new functions in them if you need to for your custom add-ons or edits.

Feel free to take a look. We have provided these functions open source and you are expected to edit them yourself if you like. Nights software does not provide specific support for custom framework integrations. But you can ofcourse ask us any question and we will try to see if our knowledge can help you.
